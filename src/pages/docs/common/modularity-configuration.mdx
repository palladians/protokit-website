# Modularity

The Protokit framework is built with modularity in mind. Under the hood, we use [`tsyringe`](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) to facilitate
constructor based dependency injection.

## Configurability

Basic building block of our modular architecture is module configurability, implemented as `ConfigurableModule`. This ensures
that any module that requires upfront configuration to work properly, will be configured accordingly and in a type-safe manner.

## Module containers

Module containers are a way to group individual related modules into a single tsyringe DI container. At the same time these containers provide
an additional layer of functionality, such as additionaly decorating said modules with configs.
