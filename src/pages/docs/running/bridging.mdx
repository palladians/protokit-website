# Bridging

Since the lightnet and berkeley settlement is still under development, the client-side bridging API is currently under development.

## Testing bridging

See a example of how to test bridging in [Settlement.test.ts](https://github.com/proto-kit/framework/blob/develop/packages/sequencer/test/settlement/Settlement.test.ts)
